# data structures

# array (Python list)
# - fast/direct access A[i]
# - requires contiguous storage
# - expensive to insert/delete
# - static memory allocation

# linked list
# - dynamic memory allocation
# - (more) efficient to insert/delete
# - high(er) cost to search (linear)
# - more flexible/efficient storage
